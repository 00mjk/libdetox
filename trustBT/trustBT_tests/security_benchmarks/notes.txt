exploit development notes
-------------------------

- program parameters, libraries, compilation... everything can change the stack's location!
- the exploit payload has to be free of termination characters/values(as '0'), even the ret address, jumpcatcher code and shellcode!
- stack location changed after restart!
- stack location changed when victim was executed out of a different directory!
- environment variables change the stack location!
- randomize_va_space seems to randomize library locations too!
