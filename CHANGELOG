libdetox 0.3 - 2010-12-10
- Reimplementation of fastBT (removal of legacy code, reducing dependencies)
  - Clear memory management, no libC dependencies, no redundant includes,
    code is formatted and consistent, no more ugly 1k lines of ASM code
  - All indirect control flow transfers now use specific trampolines
  - Implemented separate stack for libdetox functions (stack of user program
    remains clean)
  - Easier verification, only effective and used optimizations are implemented.
  - Started implementation of x86_64 code
  - Added (many) test cases and uses gtest unit testing

fastBT 0.2.1 - 2010-03-25
- Fixed a bug in the opcode tables (added correct src operands for movs* and cmps*)
- Fixup of includes (removed lots of <> includes and some "" includes)
- Bugfixing of disassembler and low level output
- Removed dependencies on libc printf, added buffering for faster output
- Extended debugging information and output available (for binary analysis)
- Reimplementation of lots of system calls and library functions in libc.c and libc.h
  * System calls are possible via int 80 and sysenter
- Removed dependencies from the libC (str functions, sysconf, memcpy)
- Reimplementation of some system calls to reduce libC dependencies (mmap, munmap)

fastBT 0.2.0 - 2010-03-10
- Removal of the bastard disassembler
- Change of the layout of the translation table (added more auxiliary information)
- Debugging mode includes dynamic code dumping and automatic disassembly using
  the same tables that are used for the translation process
- Better documentation of the security features in the Makefile
- Clearer structure and removal of dead code

fastBT 0.1.0 - 2009-11-19
- Lots of bug fixing and strengthening of the security features
- Public release at 26c3 (26th chaos communication congress in Berlin)
- Lots of new optimizations
  - Return cache and fast return
  - Optimizations for indirect calls and indirect jumps
  - Adaptive optimizations that first cache then redirect to fast lookup
  - Table optimizations
  
fastBT 0.1.0pre2 - 2009-10-22
- Lots of bug fixing
- Some security extensions (NX enforcement, secuBT stuff)
- Lots of new optimizations
  - Jumptable optimization
  - Fast return optimization
- Special optimization for low-level functions to be independent from libC
  memory management
- Special IO functions to be independent from libC (not reentrant)

fastBT 0.1.0pre - 2009-05-31
- Initial public release
- Used bastard disassembler
- Complete support for ia32 tables
- Handle pthreads
