This file describes how to install and work with fastBT.

To compile your own translation table go into the directory tableGenerator and
use "make" (have a look at example.cpp to generate a plain translation table)
The resulting translation table must then be copied into the src directory of
fastBT.

To compile the binary translator you must choose your optimizations in the
top level Makefile. After the correct settings are selected use "make" to
generate the library.

For a test run you might use:
LD_PRELOAD=./src/libfastbt.so.0.2.0 /usr/lib/openoffice/program/soffice.bin 


For 64bit systems, you need the 32bit libc: "aptitude install libc6-dev-i386.
The default installation location is /usr/lib
