This file describes how to install and work with fastBT/libdetox.

To compile your own translation table download the old fastBT distrubtion. 
Change the directory to tableGenerator and use "make" (have a look at
example.cpp to generate a plain translation table) The resulting translation
table must then be copied into the src directory of fastBT.

To compile the binary translator you must choose your optimizations in the
top level Makefile and all the Makedef.* files according to CONFIGURATION.
Additionally you need to select if you would like a debug build or a
production build. To select a debug build use "ln -s Makedefs.debug Makedefs".
To select a production build use "ln -s Makedefs.production Makedefs".
After the correct settings are selected use "make" to generate the library.

For a test run you might use:
LD_PRELOAD=./src/libfastbt.so.0.3.0 /usr/lib/openoffice/program/soffice.bin 

For 64bit systems, you need the 32bit libc: "aptitude install libc6-dev-i386.
The default installation location is /usr/lib
