The Makefile depends on "GNU libtool". This tool is easily installable
with "aptitude install libtool" under any debian/ubuntu based system.
For 64bit systems, you need the 32bit libc: "aptitude install libc6-dev-i386"

To install, run make in the "libstm" directory
(not in the subdirectory "library"):

To build the library use:
make library

To install the library use:
make install

To build some demo programs use:
(optionally)
make demoprog

the default installation location is /usr/lib
