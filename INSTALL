The Makefile depends on "GNU libtool". This tool is easily installable
with "aptitude install libtool" under any debian/ubuntu based system.

To install, run make in the "libstm" directory
(not in the subdirectory "library"):

To build the library use:
make library

To install the library use:
make install

To build some demo programs use:
(optionally)
make demoprog

the default installation location is /usr/lib
